## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added

- RBAC: roles `viewer`, `uploader`, `admin` with permission checks on all authenticated routes
- API key scopes `upload` and `read`; list/revoke via `GET/DELETE /v1/me/api-keys`

- Self-service `/settings`: password change, API key create/revoke
- Copy download link button on Captures rows (absolute URL for CI artifacts)

### Changed

- Existing SQLite databases migrate `admin` boolean to `role` + `active`; legacy `admin=1` becomes role `admin`

- Man page describes **gfs** (was incorrectly copied from groot-trigger)

## [0.1.x]

### Added

- Behavior contract: `docs/SPECIFICATIONS.md`
- Packaging scaffold mirrored from groot-trigger (Make, Docker, GoReleaser, CI)
- Stub `cmd/gfs` (`version` only; HTTP is Phase 2)
